# 5-Day-Weather-Forecast-Application

## Project
This project tested out our ability to use server APIs and access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. I was tasked with building a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story
AS A traveller.
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria for this project included:

1. Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
2. When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
3. When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
 - The city name.
 - The date.
 - An icon representation of weather conditions.
 - The temperature.
 - The humidity.
 - The wind speed.
4. When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-Day forecast that displays:
 - The date.
 - An icon representation of weather conditions.
 - The temperature.
 - The humidity.
5. When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Outcome
This project was certainly challenging, in the sense with requesting weather information of a location, you initially have to make an API Call to get the longitude and latitude of a location and then pass that through another API Call to then get the weather information of the respective location. Though it was challenging, I was able to achieve the acceptance criteria.

1. A weather dashboard with form inputs was created.
2. When the user searches for a city, they are presented both with current conditions and future conditions and lastly, the name of that city is saved and added to the search history.
3. The current weather conditions are presented with:
 - A city name.
 - The date.
 - An icon representation of weather conditions.
 - The temperature.
 - The humidity.
 - The wind speed.
4. The future weather conditions for the city searched is presented in a 5-Day forecast that displays:
 - The date.
 - An icon representation of weathe conditions.
 - The temperature.
 - The humidity.
5. Lastly when the user clicks a city in the search history they are presented with the current and future weather conditions again.
